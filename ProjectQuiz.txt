What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.

A CDN is a content dilvery network like Google or Microsoft who host jQuery so you don't have to download the file yourself.

(1) Most users have already downloaded jQuery from another site, so it just pulls it from the cache instead of downloading it again, leading to faster loading time. (2) Also, it will request files from servers that are closest to it, helping load time.(3) You don't have to download jQuery on your own, you can just use a script tag inserted in your HTML. (4) Load time is altogether faster and more efficient.
